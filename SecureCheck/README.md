# SecureCheck
A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs

**Main File Name(both py and ipynb) :** --

**Problem Statement:**
Police check posts require a centralized system for logging, tracking, and analyzing vehicle movements. Currently, manual logging and inefficient databases slow down security processes. This project aims to build an SQL-based check post database with a Python-powered dashboard for real-time insights and alerts.

**Business Use Cases:**
Real-time logging of vehicles and personnel.
Automated suspect vehicle identification using SQL queries.
Check post efficiency monitoring through data analytics.
Crime pattern analysis with Python scripts.
Centralized database for multi-location check posts.
